            <h2>About Harborview Inn &amp; Café</h2>
            <p>Harborview Inn &amp; Café is a fictional establishment inspired by the beautiful coast of southern Maine. This boutique inn began as a dream shared by our imaginary founders, a couple who fell in love with the charm of York’s rocky shores and vibrant community.</p>

            <p>Our story starts decades ago when the founders discovered a historic house overlooking the ocean. They renovated it into a welcoming bed-and-breakfast, preserving its heritage while adding modern comforts. Over the years, they added a seafood café, sourcing ingredients from local fishermen and farms.</p>

            <p>Although Harborview Inn &amp; Café doesn’t exist in real life, it reflects the warmth and hospitality you can find along Maine’s coast. We hope this sample website gives you a glimpse into what’s possible with a simple, elegant web presence.</p>
